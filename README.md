IEA PVPS Bifacial Study: pvfactors
==================================

Sandia National Laboratories and NREL co-organized a bifacial roundrobin study asking bifacial modeling software authors to run their tools against a number of scenarios, so that a global benchmark can be performed between all of those tools.

This repository contains the simulation results for ``pvfactors`` v1.4.1, and it can be used to re-run these results.
