Sandia National Laboratories and NREL co-organized a bifacial roundrobin study asking bifacial modeling software authors to run their tools against a number of scenarios, so that a global benchmark can be performed between all of these tools.

This repository contains the simulation results for ``pvfactors`` v1.4.1, and it can be used to re-run these results or check the details of the simulations.

To install the dependencies, you can run:

```bash
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
